# AHS √ó CDPC R√©sum√© Review Queue

A collaboration between the **Alexander Hamilton Society (AHS)** and the **Carnegie Mellon Career and Professional Development Center (CDPC)**.  
This web app provides a simple queue system for students to submit their r√©sum√©s for review during the **CDPC R√©sum√© Review Workshop**.

Built using **Flask**, it allows students to upload their r√©sum√© files and instructors to view and manage submissions in real time.

- Students can check in easily and upload their r√©sum√©s.
- CDPC reviewers and AHS organisers can track submissions live.
- Reviews happen efficiently without manual paper lists or confusion.

- **Instructor dashboard**: Live-updating queue of students and downloadable r√©sum√©s.  
- **Queue management**: Mark as *helping* or *done* in real time.
